Before we start anything with git, we need to get git ---  along with a few
other steps.

 1. Get git: the preferred version of git for this course is going to be
 git-for-windows, maintained by GitHub, which can be grabbed (at this
 link)[https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/latest] (the main
 website is (here)[http://git-for-windows.github.io/]).
