# Welcome to git!

This repository is the dev repository for the project meant to help you learn how to use git! The repository to clone and mess around with is at [mawillcockson/gittutor](http://www.github.com/mawillcockson/gittutor).

This tutorial is Windows-centric, but only a few commands and steps need to be changed for other platforms/OSs.

## Overview

This tutorial will try to cover all of the topics necessary to work with git, with the only assumed knowledge on the reader's part being basic computer use: If you can log on to your computer, and use it to browse the internet, perfect.

  1. Git terminology
